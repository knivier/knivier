### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a high school senior that's targetting computer engineering and embedded systems as my primary line of work. I love specializing in incredibly deeper software, such as OS development software and even kernel development! That said, I also love to code more abstract applications, such as some websites, data analysis systems (from CSVs and images, take your pick) and lots more. 

My primary language I code in is Java, but I also have lots of experience in a diverse amount of languages (Rust, HTML/CSS, Python, and others). I firmly believe that coding languages are just tools in a box that can be used for projects; like each tool in a toolbox, each language has its own advantages/disadvantages, and it's up to the programmer to decide how they wish to structure their project.

### 🛠️ Current Goals

- Achieving proficincy in more low-end languages, such as **C** and **Rust**
- Exploring the multiverse that is Javascript
- Keeping my primary projects UTD

**Some of my work is not available on GitHub due to the privacy of the work**. I have worked with labs at the University of Michigan and Van Andel Institute; therefore, I **cannot** release the code publically as there is research data with it. However, I am allowed to show how demos about these projects under demos one-on-one; contact me if you're interested!

💬 You can reach out to me on Discord or Slack via username **Knivier**. You can also reach out to me in [contact methods listed on my website](https://knivier.com/#contact).
