## Hello there!

I'm Knivier but known IRL as Agniva. You can find my personal website [by clicking here!](https://bit.ly/KnivPortal "Go to my Portfolio")

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=knivier&theme=dark&show_icons=true&hide_border=true&layout=compact)

My main and favourite language I use is Java, and if you [follow me]("https://knivier.github.io/KnivierWeb/index.html#contact") on any of my socials, you'll know I diss Python frequently. However, I sometiems still take the time to code in the language because it's becoming slowly more of a standard. My future language goals include full proficiency in Java and JavaScript for backend development, and HTML, CSS and BootStrap for the front-end experience. 

Some of my notable projects include:
- [Activerse](https://bit.ly/Activerse "Activerse Website") is a Java game engine that aims to make the GUI-based game making experience easier in Java
- [Pal](https://github.com/knivier/PalBot "Pal GitHub Repo") is a Python Discord bot that helps create a basic template for Discord bots. It was built in 2020 but has been significantly modernized since that period

That's all the projects I will list here, but I really encourage you to visit my portfolio website! That contains all of my projects and longer descriptions with them.
