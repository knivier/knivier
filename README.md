### About Me
My main and favorite language is **Java**, and if you [follow me](https://knivier.github.io/#contact) on any of my socials, you'll know I frequently diss Python. However, I sometimes still code in the language because it's slowly becoming more of a standard. 

My future goals include (on the journey to Full Stack Development):
- **Full proficiency in Java and JavaScript** for backend development, possibly with intermediate levels of Kotlin and Rust development
- **Mastering HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for a seamless front-end experience
- **Learning what the heck DevOps is** and how it could contribute to my work flow 

### Notable Projects
- **[Activerse](https://knivier.com/activerseinfo "Activerse Website")**: A Java game engine designed to make GUI-based game development easier in Java.
- **[Pal](https://github.com/knivier/PalBot "Pal GitHub Repo")**: A Python Discord bot that provides a basic template for creating Discord bots. Initially built in 2020 and significantly modernized since.
- **[Troll Game](https://knivier.com/trollgameinfo "Troll Game Website")**: A Java-based text game. Conquer as many trolls as you can to defeat Archie the best you could.

> [!NOTE]  
> Troll Game has sunsetted for the forseeable future as I want to work on other bigger projects :D
