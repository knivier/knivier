## 👋 Hello there!

I'm **Knivier**, known IRL as **Agniva**. You can check out my personal website at [knivier.com](https://knivier.com "Go to my Portfolio") to learn more about my projects and journey! For my spam account where I just build random and not functioning projects (mostly), go to [github.com/KnivSpamley]("KnivSpamley")

### 👨‍💻 About Me

My main and favorite language is **Java**. If you [follow me](https://knivier.github.io/#contact) on any of my socials, you'll know I frequently roast Python 🐍, but I still code in it because it’s becoming more of a standard in the industry. 

### 🛠️ Future Goals 

On my path to becoming a **Full Stack Developer**, my goals include:
- 🌟 Achieving **full proficiency in Java and JavaScript** for backend development, with some intermediate skills in Kotlin and Rust.
- 🎨 Mastering **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for a sleek and responsive front-end experience.
- 🤔 Understanding **DevOps** and how it can streamline my workflow.

### 🚀 Notable Projects

- **[Activerse](https://knivier.com/activerseinfo "Activerse Website")**: A Java game engine designed to simplify GUI-based game development in Java.
- **[Pal](https://github.com/knivier/PalBot "Pal GitHub Repo")**: A Python Discord bot template, initially built in 2020 and modernized over time.
- **[Troll Game](https://knivier.com/trollgameinfo "Troll Game Website")**: A Java-based text adventure game. Defeat trolls and conquer challenges to beat Archie!

> 📝 **Note**: Troll Game has been sunsetted for now as I’m focusing on bigger projects. Stay tuned for what’s next! 😄
