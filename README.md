### 👨‍💻 About Me

My main and favorite language is **Java**. For the 2025 year, I'm also changing my goals to accomodate Python, Visual Basic, C, and more web-based languages. 

### 🛠️ Future Goals 

On my path to becoming a **Full Stack Developer**, my goals include:
- 🌟 Achieving **full proficiency in Java, C, and JavaScript** for backend development, with some intermediate skills in Kotlin and Rust (already 90% there with Java)
- 🎨 Mastering **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for a sleek and responsive front-end experience.
- ~~🤔 Understanding **DevOps** and how it can streamline my workflow.~~ **Completed!**

### 🚀 Notable Projects

- **[Popcorn](https://github.com/knivier/Popcorn "Popcorn GitHub")**: A bare-metal Kernel framework that shows my ability to build projects even in languages I don't understand fully!
- **[Activerse](https://knivier.com/activerseinfo "Activerse Website")**: A Java game engine designed to simplify GUI-based game development in Java.
- **[WizViz](https://github.com/knivier/wizviz "WizViz GitHub Repo")**: A Python-based wizardry game that won Spartahack X's "best game award"; controls are CV based!
